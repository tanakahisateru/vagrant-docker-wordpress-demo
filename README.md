# Vagrant Docker Wordpress Demo

Docker development environment using Vagrant Docker provider.

```sh
vagrant up --provider=docker --no-parallel
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and enjoy WordPress.

## Pros

- Far faster boot than VirtualBox based VM (VCCW)

## Cons

- Needs Vagrant, though you already have docker-compose :P
